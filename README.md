A kata that I solved more than a year ago when I first joined Codewars, the solution is rather ugly as I just had started to learn C language and chose to create a parser
in C (yes C :D ). The parser takes in a string and converts it into an integer, but the string is a number written in words e.g Five hundred and ninety one etc. Range of numbers is from zero to one million. Nonetheless the pain
was worth it! Enjoy (:
