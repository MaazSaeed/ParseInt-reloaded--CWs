A kata that I solved more than a year ago when I first joined Codewars, the solution is rather ugly as I just had started to learn C languageand chose to create a parser
in C :D. The parser takes in a string and converts it into an integer, but the string is a number written in words e.g Five hundred and ninety one etc. Nonetheless the pain
was worth it! Enjoy (:
